### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During the HTML portion of the project, I learned the importance of using semantic tags to enhance accessibility for screen readers. In CSS, I gained a deeper understanding of Flexbox and built the entire project using it, which significantly enhanced my experience and confidence in working with Flexbox. 

### Continued development

i wish to develop more on the use of flex box in building projects as it as a lot of exciting features.
